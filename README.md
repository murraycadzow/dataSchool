A course of 10 lessons to cover additional skills beyond that delivered as part of a Carpentries 2-day workshop with a focus on reproducible research (in a computational sense)

The goal of the course is to enhance efficiency, productivity, computational reproducibility for researchers (primarily in Health Sciences). It will therefore be a data centric in nature.

To achieve this, the following general topics will be covered

- Project setup
  - environments
  - project structures
- Getting and managing data
  - data entry considerations
  - accessing databases
- Data wrangling/manipulation
  - dealing with Genomic data 
- Data visualisation
- Automation of analysis workflows
- Making reproducible reports

Prior to taking this course it is recommended to have participated in a Carpentries workshop, and be familiar with and comfortable practicing the content in the Carpentries lessons on:
- SWC - Unix Shell
- SWC - Programming with R
- SWC - R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis or DC (Ecology or Social Sciences) Data manipulation in R and Data visualisation in R
- Version control with Git
